# Linear Regression

Worked with small dataset provided by Professor Ng from Stanford's Machine Learning Course to built linear regression in Python from the ground up. All math equations are provided in course lectures and course notes.

**2 approaches:**

1) Iterative Approach (Lin_Reg_Scratch.py)

2) Matrix Approach (Lin_Reg_Vectorized.py)

## Technologies Used:
**Languages**:
Python

**Libraries**:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, scipy
